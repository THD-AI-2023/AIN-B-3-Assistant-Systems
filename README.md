## Project Description

**Assistance Systems Project** is a data-driven web application designed to help users analyze health-related data, gain valuable insights, and receive personalized recommendations aimed at reducing the risk of stroke. The system integrates multiple technologies—**Streamlit** for the frontend, **Rasa** for a conversational chatbot, and **scikit-learn** for machine learning—to deliver a comprehensive health assistance platform. 

Key functionalities include:
- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Users can upload or filter existing health data, detect outliers, and visualize correlations between features such as age, BMI, and glucose levels.
- **Machine Learning for Risk Assessment**: Multiple models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest) are trained on both real and augmented datasets to predict stroke risk. The project supports data augmentation using Faker and SMOTE to address class imbalance.
- **Personalized Health Recommendations**: By inputting personal health metrics (age, gender, BMI, etc.), users receive customized advice to mitigate stroke risk. These recommendations are generated by the trained machine learning models and displayed in a user-friendly interface.
- **Rasa-Powered Chatbot**: A built-in chatbot answers user queries, provides health insights, and offers real-time recommendations. It leverages a Rasa model for intent classification, entity extraction, and dialogue management.

By uniting these components, the **Assistance Systems Project** empowers users to make informed decisions about their health, quickly access essential insights, and engage with an intelligent chatbot for targeted recommendations—all within a single, containerized application environment.

> ### **IMPORTANT NOTE** :information_source:
>
> If you are using the chatbot feature for the first time, **please ensure that the Rasa model has been properly trained**. Training the model is crucial for the chatbot to function correctly. To train the Rasa model, please follow the instructions in the [Training the Rasa Chatbot](#training-the-rasa-chatbot) section below. Failing to train the Rasa model may result in unexpected behavior or errors when interacting with the chatbot.

## Data

### Dataset

We utilize the [Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset) from Kaggle for training and evaluation.

### Data Handling

- **Outlier Detection:** Implemented using the Z-score method to identify and handle anomalies.
- **Data Augmentation:** Added 30% realistic synthetic data to enhance dataset robustness.
- **Data Transformation:** Normalized numerical features following best practices outlined in [Google's Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/numerical-data).

## Basic Usage

### Running the Application with Docker

1. **Ensure Docker Engine is Installed:**
    Make sure Docker is installed and running on your system.

2. **Build and Start Services:**
    Navigate to the project root directory and execute:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    This command builds the Docker images, trains the Rasa model, and starts all services as defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

3. **Access the Streamlit Application:**
    Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) to access the interactive web interface.

### Training the Rasa Chatbot

If a Rasa model has not been trained in the `models/chatbot/` directory, follow these steps:

1. **Access the Rasa Server Container:**
    ```bash
    docker exec -it rasa_server bash
    ```

2. **Train the Rasa Model:**
    Inside the container, execute:
    ```bash
    rasa train
    ```

3. **Restart Services:**
    Exit the container and restart the Docker services:
    ```bash
    exit
    docker-compose down
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```

4. **Finalize Setup:**
    - Navigate to the Data Analysis page in the Streamlit app and wait for the evaluation models to finish training.
    - Once evaluations are complete, models will be available for use within the Chatbot.
    - Ensure that data filters are applied as needed and that session management maintains these filters when switching between Data Analysis and Chatbot sections.
