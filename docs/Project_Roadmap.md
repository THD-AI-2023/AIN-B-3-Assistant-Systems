## Project Overview

The **Assistance Systems Project (AIN-B)** aims to develop a data-driven recommendation system integrated with a chatbot to enhance user interaction and provide personalized suggestions. Utilizing technologies such as Streamlit for the frontend, Rasa for chatbot functionality, and Scikit-Learn for machine learning models, the project seeks to deliver an efficient and intuitive system within a condensed timeframe of three days.

## Objectives

- **Develop an Interactive Web Interface:** Create a Streamlit-based multi-page application for user interaction.
- **Implement Recommendation Engine:** Utilize Scikit-Learn to build and integrate machine learning models for personalized recommendations.
- **Integrate Chatbot:** Deploy a Rasa-powered chatbot to assist users and facilitate seamless interactions.
- **Data Handling:** Import, preprocess, augment, and transform data to ensure robustness and accuracy.
- **Documentation:** Maintain comprehensive documentation in the MyGit Wiki and a structured README.md.
- **Demonstration:** Produce a screencast video showcasing key functionalities and use cases.
